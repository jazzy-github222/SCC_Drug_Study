# SCC Analysis: Capomulin Trial Insights 💉⚕️

## Introduction 👩‍⚕️
Welcome to Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Drug Trials Analysis, this repository focuses on the drug Capomulin. As always, I'm glad to see you here! If it's your first time visiting, my name is Jazzy, the creator of this code. 

## Background 🧪
As a **Senior Data Analyst** at Pymaceuticals Inc., I'm diving into anti-cancer medication research armed with complete data from our latest animal study—249 mice treated with various regimens over 45 days. In this pivotal role, I translate data into insights that hold the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment.
- **Focus:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC), a common skin cancer.
- **Aim:** analyze Capomulin's efficacy compared to other treatments.
- **Tasks:** generate tables, figures, and a concise summary for the clinical study report.

## Key Learning Skills 🧫
- **Data preparation and cleaning 🩺:** Understanding and organizing data to ensure it is accurate and ready for analysis, such as removing duplicates or correcting errors.
- **Summary statistics calculation 🧾:** Calculating key numerical summaries of data, like averages or variability, to gain insight into its characteristics.
- **Data visualization techniques 📊:** Creating visual representations of data, like charts or graphs, to better understand patterns or trends within the data.
- **Quartile calculation and outlier detection 🔎:** Dividing data into four equal parts to identify the spread, and detecting data points that significantly differ from the rest, potentially indicating errors or anomalies.
- **Plotting line and scatter plots 📈:** Representing data points on a graph to visualize relationships between variables, such as plotting tumor volume over time or against mouse weight.
- **Correlation and regression analysis 🧠:** Evaluating the strength and direction of the relationship between variables, and using mathematical models to predict or explain the behavior of one variable based on another.
